  <h2 class="w3-center w3-robot w3-jumbo">Made with Code</h2>
  <p class="w3-center"> I discovered that Computer Science was a career in my sophomore year of high school. The following summer, I was accepted to the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at the American International Headquarters(AIG) in New York City. Here, I spent seven weeks learning the foundation of game development with Python, robotics with Arduino, and web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ever since, I have dedicated myself to attending hackathons,teaching myself through personal projects, founding the Girls Who Code Club at my high school, and even pursuing Software Engineering as a major in college. Now I want to devote my life in creating impactful things using code.</p>

    <h3> Untitled  </h3>
    <p>Untitled was a project I had developed at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. It was a books meets Pokemon Go concept. <br> We wanted to find a way for people to read and go to their local libraries more often. So when a user enters the website, they see a shelve filled with books without the title of the book. All they receive are tags that provide snippets of things found in the story and when they click on it, they receive an excerpt and on the side they see a map with an input bar. The user needs to enter in their current location and they are provided with a list of local libraries that has the speficic book. It is their job to go find it and read it, once they've accomplished  that, they receive points for reading it. A Book Adventure!</p>

  <h2 class="w3-center w3-robot w3-jumbo">Performing Arts</h2>
  <p class="w3-center"> I grew up with Filipino aunts who forced me to sing on the karaoke and dance at every Filipino party I went to. Developing a passion for performing was simply inevitable. However, not having been able to afford singing or dancing lessons, I made the most out of the resources that I had in my school. In elementary school, I joined my school's choir. In middle school, I joined the rockband. In high school, I was a musical theatre major. Now in college, I perform in the univeristy's a capella group, Stevens Quackapella. Having a background as a performer shaped my extremely outspoken and outgoing personality and I could not be more thankful for it.  </p>

    <h2 class="w3-center w3-robot w3-jumbo">High Tech Talk Show</h2>
    <p class="w3-center">In my senior year of high school, I had the amazing oppurtunity to direct a production called the "High Tech Talk Show". The High Tech Talk Show is held annually and is composed, directed, and performed by students. I was fortunate enough to contribute to the creation of the script and music and have been in the original group of performers that put on the show in its pilot year. Being asked to be its director during my last year of high school made it an extremely fulfilling experience. The reason why the High Tech Talk Show was created was due to the fact that a lot of high schools completely decide to brush off any issues that students face ranging from sexuality, pressure, stress, and mental health. They have went ahead and even labeled those things taboo. The mental health and wellness staff in the school were barely known before and we wanted to create a show that will change all of that in a funny and lighthearted way and so it happened.</p>
