  <p class="w3-center"> I am fascinated by details on the designs of billboards, posters, playbills. So much, that I began making them myself. Currently, I work as a Graphic Designer/Social Media Manager at a local dance company in my town and it has challenged me to think and research what families like to see. On my spare time, I also enjoy making posters for school events while also designing things for pure leisure.

  <p class="w3-center"> I only discovered that Computer Science could be a career my sophomore year in high school. The following summer, I joined a seven week summer immersion program which provided me with the foundation of Computer Science. Ever since, I have dedicated myself to attending hackathons,teaching myself through personal projects, as well as founding and managing the Girls Who Code Club at my high school. I want to spend the next several years in developing my skills as a creator and seeing where it takes me.</p>

    <h3> Untitled  </h3>
    <p>Untitled was a project I had developed at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. It was a books meets Pokemon Go concept. <br> We wanted to find a way for people to read and go to their local libraries more often. So when a user enters the website, they see a shelve filled with books without the title of the book. All they receive are tags that provide snippets of things found in the story and when they click on it, they receive an excerpt and on the side they see a map with an input bar. The user needs to enter in their current location and they are provided with a list of local libraries that has the speficic book. It is their job to go find it and read it, once they've accomplished  that, they receive points for reading it. A Book Adventure!</p>

  <p class="w3-center"> I was born a performer. To be fair, I could not really escape from the Daily Karaoke forced upon my Filipino aunts. (If you're a Filipino, I know you can relate) Not being able to afford singing lessons, I still sang my heart out. Joining my middle school rockband is what truly sparked my performer side. My freshman year of High School, I decided to explore other elements of the arts which is how I eventually landed as a Musical theatre Major in my high school.</p>

    <p class="w3-center">This year, I had the amazing oppurtunity to direct the High Tech Talk Show at my school. The High Tech Talk Show is a production that is put on every year and is composed, directed, and performed by students. I was fortunate enough to contribute to the creation of the script and music. For the past two years, I have performed. But this year, I directed and performed in the show creating such a rewarding experience. The reason why the High Tech Talk Show was created was due to the fact that a lot of high schools completely decide to brush off any issues that students face ranging from sexuality, pressure, stress, and mental health. They have went ahead and even labeled those things taboo. The mental health and wellness staff in the school were barely known before and we wanted to create a show that will change all of that in a funny and lighthearted way. </p>
